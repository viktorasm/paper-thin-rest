# paper-thin-rest

I needed a super-thin REST implementation over Flask.

I would very much prefer that whoever uses the code just embeds it into his own app rather than reuse as a framework. 
It's not meant to be reusable and overriden, it's meant to be a copy/paste and keep just the bits you need type of thing.
